# CashCompass VHack 2024

CashCompass is the name of the project that I have chosen for VHack 2024. This project addresses Case Study 2 (Enhancing Financial Literacy on Capital Market. 

The project will cover the following points:

 - Develop platforms or applications that provide real-time, personalized financial news and information to enhance users' understanding of 
   market trends.
 - Explore ways to make financial information and investment opportunities more accessible to a diverse audience.
 - Integrate cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence or machine learning, to provide personalized financial advice and 
   recommendations.
 - Create tools that help users set and track financial goals, budget effectively, and plan for long-term financial success.

CashCompass is a web app that has a Budget Tracker, Portfolio Builder and News section. 

:desktop_computer: The Portfolio Builder works in tandem with the Budget Tracker. The user should first enter their information into the Portfolio Builder, which will use AI to analyze and tailor the best advice for them, based on their financial goals. 

:ledger: The Budget Tracker lists all their expenses in one place, allowing for a quick and easy overview of their monthly expenditure. The web app also uses AI to compare and suggest a recommended monthly expenditure for a particular category. For example, rent, F&B, etc. It will also compare the user's spending with other users, then rank them accordingly (e.g. A user spends RM 1000.00 for F&B, out of a total monthly income of RM7,500.00. The site will compare this with other F&B expenditure to income ratio, then rank the user in terms of 'top x% of users'. 

:newspaper: The News section will use AI to browse the web and find the latest relevant news for the user. Once again, the financial goal provided by the user during the Portfolio Builder section is important as it will influence what type of news is shown. Furthermore, this section will show the price of stocks in real-time and the user has the option to 'pin' their favourite stocks to the top. This feature was inspired by Yahoo Finance. 

:green_book:The website will also have a registration and login page for users to create accounts that store their personal preferences and information. Additonally, the current UI/UX is limited, but will dynamically expand as more content is added. For example, more news articles in a real-world application. 

CashCompass was built using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, with the help of W3Schools, StackOverflow and Google.
